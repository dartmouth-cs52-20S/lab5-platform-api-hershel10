# Lab 5 API Platform

This lab was cool i struggled most creating post_controller. Using promises was key to making this section work well. Without promises, I was unable to see the error that occured wile testing my api. Promises allowed me to nicely print errors and debug while i was writing the methods. Handling req and res also was a little tricky. At first I struggled to find how to get the post id. I had to look at sa7 to see that id is stored in req.params.id.

No Extra Credit - next time maybe

# Lab 5 part 2

This part was fine. It was basically a short assignment. Just went through the instructions and it worked. Nice Nice on to the frontend.
